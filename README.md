### Introduction

  

As businesses become increasingly reliant on digital data, the need for secure and reliable backups has become more important than ever. This proposal outlines an automated backup solution for Google Drive that leverages Azure services to provide a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution for businesses of all sizes. The solution utilizes the Google Drive API to access files and folders in Google Drive, and Azure Blob Storage to store the backup data. The solution also utilizes Azure Event Hubs to provide real-time logging and Azure Key Vault to store sensitive information such as access tokens and credentials.

  

### Benefits

  

The benefits of this solution include:

  

- Automated backups of Google Drive data

- Secure storage of backups in Azure Blob Storage

- Real-time logging of backup events using Azure Event Hubs

- Easy access to stored data through Azure Portal or APIs

- Use of Azure Key Vault for secure storage of access tokens and credentials

- Scalability to meet changing backup needs

- Cost-effectiveness through pay-as-you-go pricing model

  

### Technology Stack

  

The technology stack for this solution includes:

  

- Python programming language

- Google Drive API

- Azure Blob Storage

- Azure Event Hubs

- Azure Key Vault

- Azure SDK for Python

  

### Solution Architecture

  

The solution architecture consists of four main components:

  

1. Google Drive API client - This component is responsible for accessing the Google Drive API and retrieving files and folders that need to be backed up.

2. Azure Blob Storage client - This component is responsible for connecting to Azure Blob Storage and uploading the backup data.

3. Azure Event Hubs client - This component is responsible for sending real-time logging information to Azure Event Hubs.

4. Azure Key Vault client - This component is responsible for securely storing access tokens and credentials needed for accessing the Google Drive API.

  

### Code Explanation

  

The solution consists of four Python scripts:

  

1.  `auth.py` - This script provides functions for authenticating with the Google Drive API and Azure services. It utilizes the Azure Key Vault to securely store credentials and access tokens.

2.  `get_drive_files.py` - This script retrieves a list of all files and folders in the specified Google Drive account.

3.  `upload_blob.py` - This script uploads a specified file or folder to Azure Blob Storage. It includes error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable transfer of data.

4.  `logger.py` - This script provides functions for logging events and errors to Azure Event Hubs in real-time.

  

### Testing

  

Unit tests have been created for each component of the solution to ensure the code is functioning as intended. These tests can be run individually or through a test runner program, which will execute all tests and provide a summary of the results.

  

### Solution Setup

  

To set up the solution, the following steps must be completed:

  

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the Google Drive API.

2. Create an Azure Storage account and create a container for storing backup data.

3. Create an Azure Event Hubs namespace and create a hub for receiving logging information.

4. Create an Azure Key Vault and add access policies for the solution components.

5. Clone the solution code from the Git repository.

6. Set up a Python environment and install the required packages.

7. Configure the solution by setting environment variables and providing required credentials.

8. Run the solution scripts to back up Google Drive data to Azure Blob Storage.

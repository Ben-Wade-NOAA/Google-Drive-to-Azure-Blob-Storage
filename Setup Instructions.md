## Setup Instructions: Automated Backup Solution for Google Drive using Azure

### Introduction


**Azure Setup:**

1.  Create an Azure Storage Account: Go to the Azure portal and create a new Storage Account. You can choose the pricing tier that fits your needs. Make a note of the Account name and Account key.
    
2.  Create an Azure Event Hub Namespace: Create an Azure Event Hub Namespace and an Event Hub within it. Make a note of the connection string to the Event Hub.
    
3.  Create an Azure Key Vault: Create an Azure Key Vault in the Azure portal. Add the Storage Account name, Storage Account key, Event Hub namespace connection string, and Event Hub name as secrets in the Key Vault.
    
4.  Assign permissions to the application: Create an Azure Active Directory (AD) application and assign it permissions to access the Key Vault secrets. You can do this in the Azure portal by going to the App Registrations page, creating a new application, and assigning it the "Key Vault Secrets User" role in the Key Vault Access Policies.
    
5.  Deploy the solution: Deploy the code to an Azure Function App. You can do this through the Azure portal or by using Azure CLI. Make sure to configure the Function App settings to use the Key Vault to retrieve the secrets.
    
6.  Test the solution: Upload some files to Google Drive and verify that they are being synced to the Azure Storage Account and Event Hub.
    

**Google Setup:**

1.  Create a Google API Console project: Go to the Google API Console and create a new project. Make sure that the Drive API is enabled for the project.
    
2.  Create OAuth2 credentials: Create OAuth2 credentials for the project. You can do this by going to the "Credentials" page in the API Console and selecting "Create Credentials". Choose "OAuth client ID" and select "Web application". Add the "Authorized redirect URIs" for your application. Make a note of the client ID and client secret.
    
3.  Authorize the application: Authorize the application to access your Google Drive. You can do this by using the client ID and client secret to authenticate the application and obtain an access token. You can find examples of how to do this in the Google Drive API documentation.
    
4.  Deploy the solution: Deploy the code to a server or hosting service of your choice. Make sure to set the Google API credentials as environment variables or configuration files.
    
5.  Test the solution: Upload some files to your Google Drive and verify that they are being synced to the Azure Storage Account and Event Hub.
    

**Testing:**

You can test the solution by running the automated tests provided in the test files. To run the tests, you need to have the necessary credentials and permissions set up for both Azure and Google. You can run the tests locally or in a testing environment.

**Conclusion:**

The solution described here provides a reliable and scalable way to synchronize files between Google Drive and Azure Storage, with detailed logging and error handling. By using Azure Event Hub, it is possible to monitor and analyze the synchronization activity in real-time, and by using Azure Key Vault, it is possible to securely store and retrieve the necessary credentials. The solution can be set up relatively easily, and the automated testing helps ensure that it is working correctly. The estimated costs for running this solution will depend on the chosen Azure services and the amount of data being synchronized, but should be within reasonable limits for most use cases.
